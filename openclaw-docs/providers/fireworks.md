# Fireworks

# Fireworks

[Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai) exposes open-weight and routed models through an OpenAI-compatible API. OpenClaw now includes a bundled Fireworks provider plugin.

* Provider: `fireworks`
* Auth: `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`
* API: OpenAI-compatible chat/completions
* Base URL: `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`
* Default model: `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/routers/kimi-k2p5-turbo`

## Quick start

Set up Fireworks auth through onboarding:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
openclaw onboard --auth-choice fireworks-api-key
```

This stores your Fireworks key in OpenClaw config and sets the Fire Pass starter model as the default.

## Non-interactive example

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
openclaw onboard --non-interactive \
  --mode local \
  --auth-choice fireworks-api-key \
  --fireworks-api-key "$FIREWORKS_API_KEY" \
  --skip-health \
  --accept-risk
```

## Environment note

If the Gateway runs outside your interactive shell, make sure `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`
is available to that process too. A key sitting only in `~/.profile` will not
help a launchd/systemd daemon unless that environment is imported there as well.

## Built-in catalog

| Model ref                                              | Name                        | Input      | Context | Max output | Notes                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/routers/kimi-k2p5-turbo` | Kimi K2.5 Turbo (Fire Pass) | text,image | 256,000 | 256,000    | Default bundled starter model on Fireworks |

## Custom Fireworks model ids

OpenClaw accepts dynamic Fireworks model ids too. Use the exact model or router id shown by Fireworks and prefix it with `fireworks/`.

Example:

```json5  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "fireworks/accounts/fireworks/routers/kimi-k2p5-turbo",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

If Fireworks publishes a newer model such as a fresh Qwen or Gemma release, you can switch to it directly by using its Fireworks model id without waiting for a bundled catalog update.
